# ðŸš€ Big changes in Covington!

The old Sims Furniture buildingâ€”once a landmark on our main north-south thoroughfareâ€”is being reborn as an entrepreneurial hub. Just two blocks from me, itâ€™s exciting to see this space transformed into a home for new businesses and fresh energy in our community.
