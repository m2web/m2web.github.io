                “Sanctions are not permanent—just political.”<br>
                — Anonymous diplomat, 2025
            </blockquote>
            <p>Recent reports suggest that former President Donald Trump, during backchannel preparations for a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, floated the idea of offering Russia access to <strong>rare earth minerals in Alaska</strong> and other economic incentives in exchange for peace in Ukraine. On its face, it's a diplomatic strategy. But its deeper implications may be <strong>far more consequential</strong>.</p>
            <h2>🔓 Economic Sanctions: Cracks in the Fortress</h2>
            <p>Since 2014—and especially after the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine—Russia has been the target of a vast network of Western sanctions. These sanctions have isolated Moscow from global financial systems, frozen assets, and curtailed trade in critical sectors like energy, defense, and finance.</p>
            <p>By signaling a willingness to make bilateral resource deals with Russia, Trump could be <strong>legitimizing a path back to economic normalcy</strong> for the Kremlin—without requiring meaningful accountability or reform.</p>
            <h2>🌍 A De Facto Reintegration Strategy</h2>
            <p>If the U.S. reopens economic dialogue with Russia—even under the guise of diplomacy—it could trigger a chain reaction. Allies like Hungary, Turkey, and even India might interpret this as a green light to resume or expand economic ties.</p>
            <p>In essence, this isn’t just about minerals—it’s about whether <strong>economic engagement becomes a substitute for justice</strong>.</p>
            <h2>📈 What Russia Stands to Gain</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Fresh access to Western-controlled resources</li>
                <li>Potential investment in Arctic and Siberian infrastructure</li>
                <li>Softened political isolation, especially among Global South partners</li>
                <li>A geopolitical win without a battlefield victory</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>🤝 Deal or Détente?</h2>
            <p>Critics argue that such moves amount to <strong>economic absolution without consequence</strong>. Others see it as strategic pragmatism. But there’s no denying the signal it sends: that economic power can be reclaimed—not by reform, but by waiting for a change in U.S. leadership.</p>
            <h2>🧭 Summary Table</h2>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr><th>Action</th><th>Implication</th></tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr><td>Trump offers mineral access to Russia</td><td>Undermines multilateral sanctions</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Unilateral U.S.–Russia peace overture</td><td>Fractures Western diplomatic unity</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>Putin gains economic legitimacy</td><td>Restores global influence without war’s end</td></tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <h2>⚠️ Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>Sanctions are only as strong as the unity behind them. If one major player defects—especially the United States—it risks <strong>unraveling the post-Ukraine sanctions regime entirely</strong>. Russia's economic comeback may not come through war or diplomacy—but through <em>negotiated normalization</em>.</p>
