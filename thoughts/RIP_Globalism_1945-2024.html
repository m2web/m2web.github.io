        <p><em>The End of an Era and the Birth of a New Economic Order</em></p>

        <p>For nearly 80 years, globalism was the defining framework of American economic and foreign policy... That era is now over.</p>

        <h2>The Arc of Globalism (1945â€“2024)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1945â€“1971:</strong> Bretton Woods, Marshall Plan, IMF, World Bank</li>
            <li><strong>1970sâ€“1990s:</strong> Deregulation, NAFTA, WTO, multinational expansion</li>
            <li><strong>2000sâ€“2010s:</strong> China's rise, hyper-financialization, inequality</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2024: The Breaking Point</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Strategic tariffs imposed to <strong><em>weaken the dollar</em></strong></li>
            <li>Shift from openness to protectionism in immigration and land policy</li>
            <li>New economic doctrines challenge free-market globalism</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The New Paradigm: Sovereignty Over Systems</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Devalue the dollar</em></strong> to boost exports</li>
            <li>Reshore manufacturing</li>
            <li>Use tariffs for leverage</li>
            <li>Limit foreign capital inflows</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Dollar Dilemma: Weaker Currency as a Strategic Tool</h2>
        <p>
            Central to this economic reset is the belief that the U.S. dollar must be weakened to make American exports competitive again.
            A strong dollar, while good for Wall Street and foreign buyers of U.S. assets, has made it harder for Main Street and the American manufacturers
            to sell abroad and compete with imports at home. By discouraging foreign capital inflows and resetting interest rate incentives,
            the Trump administration is betting on a structural shift: a cheaper dollar that favors producers over speculators.
        </p>
        <p>
            This transition could have profound consequences for middle- and working-class Americans. On one hand, it will likely lead to higher
            prices for imported goodsâ€”everything from electronics to foodâ€”effectively raising the cost of living. On the other, it's possible it will
            spur a revival in domestic production, creating more blue-collar jobs and lifting wages in sectors long considered dead.
            <strong>Whether this trade-off pays off will depend on how fast industry scales, and how well policymakers cushion the blow of inflation
            in the interim.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Insights from Stephen Miranâ€™s Framework</h2>
        <p>
            Economist Stephen Miran, in his paper <em>A User's Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System</em>, 
            outlines a strategy for overhauling international trade. He emphasizes that the persistent overvaluation 
            of the U.S. dollar hampers American manufacturing competitiveness. Miran advocates for tariffs and currency 
            policy adjustments to address these challenges. He proposes a coordinated approach that intertwines 
            economic policy with national security considerations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Notably, Miran discusses the potential for a "Mar-a-Lago Accord," a modern counterpart to the 1985 Plaza Accord. 
            This aims to realign currency values through multilateral agreements. He also explores unilateral tools 
            available to the U.S., such as using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to influence 
            currency markets. These strategies aim to redistribute the financial burdens of global reserve currency 
            provision and defense commitments more equitably among international partners.
        </p>
        <p>

        <h2>What Died, and Whatâ€™s Being Born</h2>
        <p><strong>RIP Globalism.</strong> In less than 100 days by the words and actions of the Trump administration, gone is the perception that we could run persistent deficits and float on financial dominance forever.</p>
        <p>In its place rises a new, messy, confrontational worldview: industrial sovereignty, controlled capital, and territorial identity.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion: The Funeral Is Over. Now Time Will Tell.</h2>
        <p>The death of globalism isnâ€™t just a policy shiftâ€”itâ€™s a cultural and generational realignment. The world is watching to see whether this new experiment ends in rebirthâ€”or ruins.</p>
        <p><strong>History will judge. But 2024, in my view, will be remembered as the year the music stopped.</strong></p>
