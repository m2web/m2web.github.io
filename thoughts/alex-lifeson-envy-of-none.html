            <p>For over four decades, <strong>Alex Lifeson</strong> carved his name into the bedrock of rock history as the groundbreaking guitarist of <em>Rush</em>. With intricate arrangements, ever-evolving guitar tones, and a fearless approach to composition, Lifeson helped redefine what it meant to be a rock musician. But what happens after you’ve already scaled the mountain? If you’re Alex Lifeson, you don’t stop—you evolve.</p>
            <p>Enter <strong><em>Envy of None</em></strong>.</p>
            <p>This bold and evocative project showcases Lifeson not as a nostalgic rocker revisiting past glories, but as an artist fully alive in the present—exploring fresh sonic terrain with an entirely new band. Alongside <strong>Alf Annibalini</strong> (guitar, keyboards), <strong>Andy Curran</strong> (bass, guitar, vocals), and the ethereal <strong>Maiah Wynne</strong> (vocals, keyboards), Lifeson delves into textured soundscapes that feel both haunting and intimate.</p>
            <p>Their latest single, accompanied by a striking video, is a compelling meditation on the struggle to change.<br>

            Per Maiah Wynne:<br>
            <blockquote>
                <p>“I wrote about wanting to be better, to grow, and the sense of desperation that comes with that desire... I think it’s a theme a lot of people can connect with in some way. Whether it's habits, addiction, self-sabotage, or just unhealthy patterns, we all are trapped by something we are trying to break away from. If I had the power to write my own story, I’d want to be the hero, but so often I am my own villain.”</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Lifeson’s guitar work is no less expressive. With <em>Envy of None</em>, he trades blistering solos and odd-time riffing for something more atmospheric—almost cinematic. His playing becomes a character in the story: moody, melodic, restrained, yet deeply resonant. Whether he's layering in <strong>mandola</strong> textures or coaxing emotion from the <strong>oud</strong>, Lifeson proves that true artistry is not bound by genre or ego—it’s bound only by curiosity and courage.</p>
            <p>This isn't just a side project. It's a <strong>reinvention</strong>. And it's a reminder that even legends can still surprise us.</p>
