# Alex Lifeson’s New Sonic Frontier: The Bold Brilliance of *Envy of None*

For over four decades, **Alex Lifeson** carved his name into the bedrock of rock history as the groundbreaking guitarist of *Rush*. With intricate arrangements, ever-evolving guitar tones, and a fearless approach to composition, Lifeson helped redefine what it meant to be a rock musician. But what happens after you’ve already scaled the mountain? If you’re Alex Lifeson, you don’t stop—you evolve.

Enter **_Envy of None_**.

This bold and evocative project showcases Lifeson not as a nostalgic rocker revisiting past glories, but as an artist fully alive in the present—exploring fresh sonic terrain with an entirely new band. Alongside **Alf Annibalini** (guitar, keyboards), **Andy Curran** (bass, guitar, vocals), and the ethereal **Maiah Wynne** (vocals, keyboards), Lifeson delves into textured soundscapes that feel both haunting and intimate.

Their latest single, accompanied by a striking video, is a compelling meditation on the struggle to change.

Vocalist Maiah Wynne explains the emotional depth:

> “I wrote about wanting to be better, to grow, and the sense of desperation that comes with that desire... I think it’s a theme a lot of people can connect with in some way. Whether it's habits, addiction, self-sabotage, or just unhealthy patterns, we all are trapped by something we are trying to break away from. If I had the power to write my own story, I’d want to be the hero, but so often I am my own villain.”

Lifeson’s guitar work is no less expressive. With *Envy of None*, he trades blistering solos and odd-time riffing for something more atmospheric—almost cinematic. His playing becomes a character in the story: moody, melodic, restrained, yet deeply resonant. Whether he's layering in **mandola** textures or coaxing emotion from the **oud**, Lifeson proves that true artistry is not bound by genre or ego—it’s bound only by curiosity and courage.

This isn't just a side project. It's a **reinvention**. And it's a reminder that even legends can still surprise us.

In *Envy of None*, Lifeson doesn’t merely add his name—he adds his soul.  
And for fans of Rush, of progressive rock, or of deeply human music in any form, that’s a gift worth savoring.
