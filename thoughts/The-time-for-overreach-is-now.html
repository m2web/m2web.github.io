        “How far should a democracy go when confronting political violence?”<br>
        — Framing question, 2025
      </blockquote>

      <h2>🧭 Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Context:</strong> The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk triggered a national moment of grief and a sharp political response. The White House and its allies cast blame on what they call “radical left political violence,” promising sweeping “consequences.”</p>
      <p><strong>Thesis:</strong> What began as mourning now risks becoming a mandate for expansive state action. This article examines the proposed measures, their constitutional tensions, and the risks of overreach.</p>

      <h2>📋 Key Developments</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>White House stance:</strong> Officials signal crackdowns on online speech that “glorifies” violence, though how this would be defined remains unclear.</li>
        <li><strong>Broader targets:</strong> Educators, healthcare workers, and other public servants may face scrutiny for posts deemed inappropriate.</li>
        <li><strong>Visa policies:</strong> Non-citizens celebrating political violence could face immigration consequences, an unprecedented signal tying speech to status.</li>
        <li><strong>Allied voices:</strong> Republicans outside the administration call for still harsher steps, extending potential consequences into licensing and credentials.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>⚖️ Constitutional Crossroads</h2>
      <p><strong>Existing law already prohibits direct threats and incitement to imminent violence.</strong> What’s at stake is how far government may go in policing speech that is offensive or celebratory but not immediately dangerous. <strong>Expanding the perimeter risks eroding free expression, due process, and academic freedom.</strong></p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><em>Key tension:</em> Can safety be enhanced without chilling dissent—or is the nation entering a period of state-backed overreach in the name of security?</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>🔚 Conclusion</h2>
      <p><strong>The White House response reflects real grief but also a temptation: to use tragedy as justification for broad restrictions.</strong> Whether the coming months bring narrowly tailored enforcement or sweeping measures that corrode liberal norms will determine if this moment is remembered as prudent or as perilous.</p>
