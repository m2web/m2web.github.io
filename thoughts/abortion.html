            <h1>A Biblical Case for Allowing Abortion in Secular Government</h1>
            
            <p><strong>1. Respect for Free Will:</strong> God grants free will, allowing individuals to make moral choices (Genesis 2–3). In a pluralistic society, secular laws must respect diverse beliefs and give individuals the freedom to wrestle with moral issues themselves.</p>
            
            <p><strong>2. Role of Secular Authority:</strong> Governments are established to maintain justice and order (Romans 13:1–7), not to impose a single religious viewpoint. Laws must balance protecting life with respecting women’s rights and health.</p>
            
            <p><strong>3. Compassion for Complex Situations:</strong> Scripture emphasizes mercy for the vulnerable (Micah 6:8). Allowing abortion in cases of rape, incest, or medical necessity reflects compassion in a broken world.</p>
            
            <p><strong>4. Moral Advocacy, Not Legal Coercion:</strong> The Gospel advances through love and persuasion, not force (John 18:36). Christians can advocate for life and support alternatives without imposing their morality through law.</p>
            
            <p><strong>5. Focus on Justice and Mercy:</strong> Justice requires laws that avoid disproportionate burdens on the poor or marginalized (Micah 6:8). Supporting healthcare, adoption, and parental leave aligns with biblical values.</p>
            
            <p><strong>6. Transforming Hearts Over Laws:</strong> Jesus prioritized heart transformation over legislating morality (Matthew 22:37–40). Christians can work to change hearts and foster a culture of life without relying solely on legal restrictions.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> While affirming the sanctity of life, Christians can acknowledge that secular governments serve diverse populations. Allowing lawful abortion respects individual freedom while enabling the church to focus on advocacy, support, and living out the Gospel in transformative ways.</p>
