            <strong>Hawkish isolationism</strong> means a country wants to stay out of other countries' problems but still acts tough, 
            like a kid on the playground who doesn’t want to play with others but still threatens to take their toys if they don’t behave.

            <strong>Hawkish isolationism</strong> is when a country avoids making strong friendships with others but still uses threats, 
            military power, or economic pressure to get its way. It’s like a student who doesn’t want to be part of a group project 
            but still demands control over what the group does.

            <strong>Hawkish isolationism</strong> is a foreign policy approach where a nation withdraws from global alliances and 
            international commitments but maintains an aggressive stance through economic sanctions, military threats, or selective 
            interventions. It reflects a balance between nationalism and power projection, often prioritizing domestic interests 
            while deterring foreign influence.

        <h2 id="graduate">For the Graduate Student 🎓</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Hawkish isolationism</strong> describes a geopolitical strategy in which a state minimizes entanglements in 
            international institutions and alliances while simultaneously maintaining a forceful approach to foreign policy. 
            This includes leveraging economic sanctions, military deterrence, and unilateral decision-making to protect 
            national interests without engaging in prolonged global commitments.

        <h2 id="phd">The PhD 🎓📜</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Hawkish isolationism</strong> is a hybrid foreign policy doctrine characterized by strategic disengagement 
            from multilateral institutions and traditional alliances, coupled with assertive unilateral actions, including 
            economic coercion and military posturing. It reflects a realist-nationalist synthesis where state actors 
            prioritize sovereignty and domestic agendas while maintaining the capacity for coercive diplomacy and 
            selective interventionism to sustain geopolitical leverage.
