# TODO for Debugging Resume Injection in Worker

1. **Verify RESUME_SUCCINCT in KV**
   - Double-check in the Cloudflare dashboard that the RESUME_SUCCINCT key exists in the correct KV namespace and contains valid JSON.
   - Ensure the value matches the expected structure (summary and experience_titles).

2. **Test Regex Triggers**
   - Use POST requests with messages like:
     - "Tell me about Mark McFadden."
     - "Who is Mr. McFadden?"
     - "Mark was a developer."
   - Confirm that at least one of these triggers the regex and logs debug output.

3. **Check Wrangler Tail**
   - Run `npx wrangler tail` before sending POST requests.
   - Look for logs: `[DEBUG] User message:`, `[DEBUG] Regex match results:`, `[RESUME INJECTED]`, and `[DEBUG] Full messages array:`.

4. **Add More Logging if Needed**
   - If no logs appear, add a `console.log('[DEBUG] Entered POST handler')` at the start of the POST handler to confirm code path.
   - Log the entire request body to ensure the expected structure is received.

5. **Validate Worker Deployment**
   - Make sure the latest Worker code is deployed to your production environment.
   - If using environments, confirm you are tailing and testing the correct one.

6. **Test System Message Injection**
   - Temporarily set the system message to a static string (e.g., "TEST SYSTEM MESSAGE") to confirm injection and model response.
   - If the model repeats the test message, resume logic is working; if not, debug further.

7. **Review wrangler.toml**
   - Ensure the KV binding name in wrangler.toml matches `RESUME` in your Worker code.

8. **Check for Errors in Wrangler Output**
   - If any command fails, copy the full error message for troubleshooting.

9. **Optional: Add a /debug Endpoint**
   - Add a GET /api/debug endpoint to return the current value of RESUME_SUCCINCT and other debug info for easier troubleshooting.

Pick up here tomorrow to continue debugging the resume injection and logging!
