# Website Enhancement Ideas (2001: A Space Odyssey Theme)

This document outlines potential enhancements to build upon the existing *2001: A Space Odyssey* website theme.

---

### Thematic & Interactive Enhancements

1.  **Interactive HAL 9000 Console:**
    *   Make the "Diagnostics" section interactive.
    *   **Idea:** A simple command-line interface where typing `RUN DIAGNOSTICS` triggers a scrolling text animation, or `SYSTEM STATUS` shows green "OK" messages.

2.  **Subtle Sound Design:**
    *   Add optional, user-initiated sound effects.
    *   **Idea:** A button could toggle the low hum of the *Discovery One* ship or play a classic HAL sound bite to deepen immersion.

3.  **Animated Backgrounds:**
    *   Introduce a subtle, animated starfield background for the entire page or specific sections.
    *   **Goal:** Evoke the feeling of being in space.

4.  **Monolith as a Loading Element:**
    *   Use a black monolith shape as a page loader or for transitions between pages/sections.
    *   **Goal:** Reinforce the core visual theme.

### Content & UX Improvements

1.  **Thematic Content Sections:**
    *   Reframe existing content to match the theme.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "About Me" -> "Crew Manifest"
        *   "Projects" -> "Mission Archives"
        *   "Blog/Thoughts" -> "Ship's Log"

2.  **Mobile Responsiveness:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test the design on mobile and tablet devices.
    *   **Goal:** Ensure the minimalist, blocky style adapts well and remains usable.

3.  **Accessibility Review:**
    *   Check that the red-on-black text contrast ratio meets WCAG accessibility standards.
    *   Ensure all animations and transitions respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query.

### Technical Polish

1.  **Image Optimization:**
    *   Analyze and optimize all images (e.g., the HAL eye) for the web.
    *   **Goal:** Improve page loading times.

2.  **Code Cleanup:**
    *   Review existing CSS files (`w3.css`, `darkmode.css`).
    *   **Goal:** Determine if they are still necessary with the new `2001.css` and remove any redundant code to simplify maintenance.
