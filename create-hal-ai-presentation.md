### 6. Implementation Approach

#### Phase 1: Platform Setup

1. Choose presentation technology (Python or JavaScript)
2. Set up basic slide framework
3. Implement HAL theming and styling
4. Create slide structure and navigation

#### Phase 2: AI Integration

1. Integrate OpenAI API for real-time demonstrations
2. Set up live HAL console embedding
3. Implement AI-generated content features
4. Test AI responses and context awareness

#### Phase 3: Content Development

1. Use AI to generate initial slide content
2. Refine and customize generated content
3. Add interactive elements and demonstrations
4. Create speaker notes and presentation flow

#### Phase 4: Polish & Testing

1. Test all interactive AI features
2. Optimize performance and loading times
3. Create fallback content for offline demos
4. Finalize documentation and setup guides
